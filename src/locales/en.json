  "bjp_description": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is now the world's largest political party in terms of membership. The current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, worked with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) during his formative years.\n\n**How Did It Start?**\nThe earlier avatar of the BJP was known as the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. After resigning from Jawaharlal Nehru’s cabinet, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee requested volunteers from the RSS to form a political party. The then RSS chief, Guruji (M. S. Golwalkar), agreed, and the Jana Sangh was established in 1951.\n\n**How Is It Going?**\nIn 1980, the Jana Sangh was rechristened as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since then, it has gained power in multiple states and at the Centre. What changes can the nation witness when leaders imbued with Sangh values come to power? Below are a few examples:\n\n- **Self-Reliance and Strength:** The RSS has always emphasized self-reliance and speaking from a position of strength. Reflecting this ethos, the Vajpayee government boldly conducted the Pokhran nuclear tests, standing firm against international pressure.\n\n- **National Integration and Unity:** The RSS upholds national unity as its core objective. The Modi government’s abrogation of Article 370 ended Jammu and Kashmir's separate identity, reinforcing this vision.\n\n- **Public Duty Over Power:** The erstwhile Rajpath in New Delhi, once perceived as an 'icon of power,' was redeveloped as 'Kartavya Path', symbolizing a sense of duty and public ownership.\n\n- **Antyodaya – Development of the Last Person:** Initiatives like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan by the Vajpayee government, and schemes such as Ujjwala Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by the Modi government, have uplifted millions by providing LPG connections and sanitation facilities to those in need.",
